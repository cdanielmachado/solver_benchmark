## "A benchmark of optimization solvers for genome-scale metabolic modeling" Machado D. (2023)

--------

This work compares several optimization solvers for genome-scale metabolic modeling:

- CPLEX
- GUROBI
- GLPK
- COIN-OR
- SCIP
- HiGHS

This repository contains the scripts and models required to reproduce the benchmarking results, as well as the generated data, and the jupyter notebooks to reproduce the figures in the paper.
