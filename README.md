### Supplementary material for: *A benchmark of optimization solvers for genome-scale metabolic modeling of organisms and communities, mSystems, 2024*

This repository contains the scripts and models required to reproduce the benchmarking results, as well as the generated data, and the jupyter notebooks to reproduce the figures in the paper.

This work compares several optimization solvers for genome-scale metabolic modeling:

- CPLEX
- GUROBI
- GLPK
- COIN-OR
- SCIP
- HiGHS
